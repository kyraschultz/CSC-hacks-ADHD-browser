# CSC Hacks ADHD Browser Extension


## Project Description
* We want to create a browser extension that helps people with ADHD/people looking for motivation to complete boring tasks. 
* We want to do this because we have experience procrastinating our homework until it gets super close to the deadline and becomes super stressful to complete
* Doing this will require learning javascript, displaying animations, and building chrome extensions. 
* We anticipate the following challenges: getting over how disgusting javacript is, figuring out animation details, and learning about browser extensions overall.
